## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Webpack - I was practicing my Modularization and bundling

### What I learned

Taking on this challenge provided an in-depth understanding of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and ES6 Modules. Key learnings include:

* Solid grasp of Webpack and its configuration
* Enhanced skills in CSS, particularly using ::before and ::after pseudo-elements
* Implementation of a shopping cart for an E-commerce project
* Improved understanding of UX design principles

### Continued development

I plan to revisit this project after completing my current curriculum on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Future enhancements may include:

* Improved mobile responsiveness
* Implementing a carousel for image looping

### Useful resources

- [Webpack JavaScript Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-webpack) - This resource was instrumental in understanding and applying Webpack.
